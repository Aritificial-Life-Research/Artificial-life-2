	<h2>What is particle swarm optimisation?</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
		Particle swarm optimisation is a heuristic algorithm that has evolved
		from artificial life techniques. Particle swarm optimisations uses
		simple autonomous agents to explore a search space. Each agent simply
		follows an equation to update its position in the environment at
		each time step. There are a multitude of different equations that can
		be used for this update depending on the problem that is being solved.
		A number of these are discussed in [<a href="#ref4">4</a>].

		The attraction
		to food modelled in the fish simulator was inspired by particle swarm
		optimisation in that when a fish has eaten some food, this is stored as
		a local best for the agent, and the food creates a global best. This means
		that agents are drawn to either a local best or global best depending on
		which they are closer to.
