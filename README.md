# Artificial Life
Here is the code for the website I developed for my Swarm Intelligence & Artificial Life module.
The website utilising Twitter Bootstrap and AngularJS for rapid prototyping and contains an artificial life demo that is coded entirely in JavaScript - Again controlled by AngularJS to give the maximum integration into the browser.

The demo is of fish schoaling and is based on the boids model of flocking behaviour. Some unique elements have been added through the introduction of a way to "feed" the fish by clicking the mouse and even introduce a preditor into the environment. More description into these is given on the site itself.

A full life version of this can be found at: http://developer.olliespage.net/swarm
