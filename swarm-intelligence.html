	<h2>What is swarm intelligence?</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">
		Swarm intelligence is the study of systems that are inspired by collective behaviour.
		It can be used for solving tasks such as: optimisation, search and multi-agent coordination. A key aspect
		of swarm intelligence is that each agent in the system is a simple model that can interact with
		others and the environment. There is no central controller for the system and all global
		interactions are emergent behaviours. Sometimes, agents interact with others through the
		environment, such as by leaving a pharamone trail that others can follow. - This interaction
		is similar to how ants communicate. By interacting swarms are able to produce highly complex
		global behaviours, whilst only performing simple operations at an individual level.

		The demonstration developed was inspired by two areas of swarm intelligence: artificial life and particle swarm optimisation.
		These are discussed in more detail in their own section below, including how they influenced the demonstration.
