	<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">Both artificial life and swarm intelligence
		were initially inspired by nature which has shown evidence of being
		able to find solutions to highly complex problems. By using simplistic
		agents that do not require highly complex processing, these techniques
		can be used to great effect to solve a multitude of problems. By
		drawing on nature to inspire movement and using partical swarm
		techniques to search a search space, systems that are able to search
		extremely hostile environments can be developed cheaply with low cost
		parts.</p>
